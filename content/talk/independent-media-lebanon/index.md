excerpt: On August 4, 2700 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in Beirut's port ripped through half of the capital, taking 200 lives, injuring thousands and rendering 300,000 homeless. The impact of the blast was also felt by independent media workers, who'd had -- over the years -- taken up headquarters in the neighborhoods that had been hit the most.
