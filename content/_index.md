description: I am a doctoral student in Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. My work and research sit at the intersection of media, technology and human rights. Particularly, I examine the political economy of disinformation in SWANA/MENA and the effect of content moderation policies on Arab independent media, access to information, and free speech online.
