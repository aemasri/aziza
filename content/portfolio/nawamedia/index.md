title: The NAWA Media Check Newsroom

The NAWA Media Newsroom was launched in 2017 with a team of journalism students from the Lebanese University. I joined Meedan's [Check Global](https://meedan.com/programs/check-global) program in December 2019 with the explicit role to coordinate the newsroom. So in 2020, the newsroom expanded to include students from Syria, Yemen and Egypt, followed by a new cohort of students from Palestine in 2021.

In 2020, I supported students through a collaborative participatory approach to editorial and newsroom management. Country-specific teams collaboratively agreed on their editorial standards and thematic priorities for the year, and each journalism student had the opportunity to be a country-specific copyeditor and/or editor-in-chief (EiC)--with the responsibility of setting up weekly pitch meetings and weekly editorial meetings with other country EiCs and myself. Thanks to this rotating newsroom structure, every student learned key journalism skills: editing, decision-making and prioritizing, teamwork, proofreading, and time management. 

These country-focused newsrooms reported on: [the effect of COVID-19 on the economy in Yemen](https://ar.nawamedia.org/newsroom/posts/5687/); [medical shortages in Egypt](https://nawamedia.org/newsroom/posts/black-market-covid-19-shortages-and-overlooked-heroes/); [threats faced by journalists in Syria](https://ar.nawamedia.org/newsroom/posts/6852/); and [the mental health consequences of the Beirut blast](https://ar.nawamedia.org/newsroom/posts/6846/). They also worked on podcasts, infographics, and investigations. This wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the six-month training program that I'd organized and managed with openDemocracy, where students learned about sourcing, digital security, investigative journalism, podcasting, open-source investigations, and others. The recordings of these sessions are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpcB32oiz_IMMvYnyXMhWkWFLa-gTgYBz). 

In 2021, I expanded the newsroom further to include students from Palestine and to focus on fact-checking health misinformation. With my colleague, we built a six-month media monitoring and fact-checking training program focused on collaboratively building an open-source participatory methodology in the Arabic language. With additional support from Skeyes Media: Centre for Media and Cultural Freedom, this project culminated in the release of the [Media Credibility Index](/portfolio/media-credibility-index) in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
