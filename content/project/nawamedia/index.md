The NAWA Media Newsroom was launched in 2017 with a team of journalism students from the Lebanese University. In 2020, new students joined from Syria, Yemen and Egypt, followed by a new cohort of students from Palestine in 2021.

In 2020, country-focused newsrooms reported on: the effect of COVID-19 on the economy in Yemen; medical shortages in Egypt; threats faced by journalists in Syria; and the mental health consequences of the Beirut blast. They also worked on podcasts, infographics, and investigations. This wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the six-month training program that I'd organized and managed with openDemocracy, where students learned about sourcing, digital security, investigative journalism, podcasting, open-source investigations, and others. The recordings of these sessions are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpcB32oiz_IMMvYnyXMhWkWFLa-gTgYBz). 

In 2021, I expanded the Newsroom further to include students from Palestine and to focus on fact-checking health misinformation, this time with additional support from Skeyes Media: Centre for Media and Cultural Freedom, leading to the release of the [Media Credibility Index](https://ar.nawamedia.org/media-credibility-index/) in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
