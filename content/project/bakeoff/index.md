title: The NAWA Media Check Newsroom
---

---
The NAWA Media Newsroom was launched in 2017 with a team of journalism students from the Lebanese University. In 2020, new students joined us from Syria, Yemen and Egypt, followed by a new cohort of students from Palestine and Sudan in 2021.

In 2020, country-focused newsrooms reported on: the effect of COVID-19 on the economy in Yemen; medical shortages in Egypt; threats faced by journalists in Syria; and the mental health consequences of the Beirut blast. They also worked on podcasts, infographics, and investigations. This wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the six-month training program we organized with openDemocracy, where students learned about sourcing, digital security, investigative journalism, podcasting, open-source investigations, and others. The recordings of these sessions are available on YouTube. 

In 2021, we expanded the Newsroom further, to include students from Palestine and to focus on fact-checking health misinformation, this time with additional support from Skeyes Media: Centre for Media and Cultural Freedom, leading to the release of the [Media Credibility Index](https://ar.nawamedia.org/media-credibility-index/) in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
