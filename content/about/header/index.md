<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a doctoral student in Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. I have worked as a journalist, disinformation expert, and digital security consultant with independent media organizations, human rights organizations, and journalism students across SWANA/MENA to develop and support open-source investigations and fact-checking projects.

My work and research sit at the intersection of media, technology and human rights. Particularly, I examine the political economy of disinformation in NAWA and the effect of content moderation policies on Arab independent media, access to information, and free speech online.
